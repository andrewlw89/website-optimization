This project was done as part of the Udacity Font-end Web Developer Nanodegree. The goal is to take a website that is already working and optimize it in a way to improve performance.

STEP 1: Optimize index.html to acheive a pagespeed score of over 90 from Google pagespeed insights.

In order to accomplish this, I initially ran the pagespeed test on index.html to find out suggestions for where to start.
1. The most obvious fix was to resize and compress all images on the page.
2. Next I had to deal with render blocking javascript and css. For the css, I decided to put the styles in an imbedded style tag
   to fix this issue.
3. To deal with the render blocking javascript, I used the async tag for the google analytics since they were not integral to the loading of the page.

STEP 2: Optimize pizza.html to achieve a frame rate of 60 frames per second.
1. My initial timeline showed that alot of time was being used during the scripting process. To fix this, I found a for-loop that was performing
   certain calculations more times than it should. I moved these calculations out of the loop to reduce scripting time.
2. Next I noticed that, no matter the size of the browser, 200 pizzas were being rendered in the background which was causing alot of time to be
   spent painting and rasterizing. To deal with this, I used javascript to determine the size of the window on resize and only generate as many
   pizzas were actually in the viewport. I also set an event for resizing the browser so that the number of pizzas would match the size of the browser.
3. I compressed and minified all CSS, JavaScript, and images to reduce time being painted, scripting, and loading.
4. Lastly, the slider that changed the size of the pizzas on the screen was using a JavaScript for loop to interate through all of the pizzas and
   resize them. The issue was that the loop was causing the layout to be recalculated after each loop which caused alot of time being wasted in the layout.
   I chose to instead use JavaScript to add CSS classes to the pizzacontainer tags and then created a CSS style rule that would resize them based on the tag. 


## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
